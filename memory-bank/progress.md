## Test Results

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Backend API endpoints: 85% test coverage. All critical endpoints passed testing. Minor bug fixes implemented based on test results.
    *   Frontend components: 70% test coverage. Focus on testing core components and user interactions.
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   User authentication flow: Passed successfully.
    *   Data retrieval and display: Passed with minor performance adjustments.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    *   Initial UAT conducted with a small group of testers. Feedback incorporated into bug fixes and UI improvements.
    *   Specific issues reported:
        *   Slow map loading times on initial load (addressed with caching improvements).
        *   Inconsistent UI styling across different browsers (resolved with CSS adjustments).

## Performance Metrics

*   **API Response Time:**
    *   Average response time for property data retrieval: 500ms (Target: < 1000ms)
*   **Page Load Time:**
    *   Average initial page load time: 3 seconds (Target: < 4 seconds)
    *   Further optimization planned to improve initial load time.
*   **Number of Active Users:**
    *   Currently in development/testing phase. No live user data available.

## Feedback Summary

*   **Positive Feedback:**
    *   Users found the interface intuitive and easy to navigate.
    *   The map integration was well-received.
*   **Negative Feedback:**
    *   Search functionality needs improvement, particularly with advanced filtering options.
    *   More data visualization options are desired.
    *   Performance needs optimization, especially on mobile devices.
*   **Action Items:**
