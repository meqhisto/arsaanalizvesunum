## Technology Context (techContext.md)

This document outlines the technological landscape of the Arsa Analiz ve Sunum Projesi, detailing the technologies, tools, environments, and processes utilized throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Chosen for its component-based architecture, virtual DOM for performance, and large community support.
    *   **Redux:** A state management library for React applications. Used for managing complex application state and ensuring predictable data flow.
    *   **JavaScript (ES6+):** The primary language for frontend development, leveraging modern features for improved code readability and maintainability.
    *   **HTML5:**  For structuring the web application's content.
    *   **CSS3:**  For styling the web application and providing a visually appealing user experience. Specifically, we'll be using:
        *   **Styled Components:**  CSS-in-JS library for component-level styling.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Python:** The primary language for backend development, chosen for its ease of use, extensive libraries, and suitability for data analysis.
    *   **Flask:** A micro web framework for Python. Used for building the API endpoints and handling HTTP requests.
    *   **SQLAlchemy:** An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for Python. Used for interacting with the database in a Pythonic way.
*   **Database:**
    *   **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system. Chosen for its reliability, scalability, and support for advanced data types.
*   **Data Analysis & Visualization:**
    *   **Pandas:** A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
    *   **NumPy:** A Python library for numerical computing.
    *   **Matplotlib:** A Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
    *   **GeoPandas:** A Python library for working with geospatial data in Pandas.
    *   **Leaflet:** An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
*   **Other:**
    *   **Docker:** For containerizing the application for consistent deployment across different environments.
    *   **Nginx:** A web server used as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

## Software Development Tools

*   **IDE:**
    *   **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A lightweight but powerful source code editor with support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   **Git:** A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
    *   **GitHub:** A web-based hosting service for version control using Git. Used for collaborative development and code management.
*   **Package Managers:**
    *   **npm (Node Package Manager):**  For managing JavaScript dependencies on the frontend.
    *   **pip (Pip Installs Packages):** For managing Python dependencies on the backend.
*   **Build Tools:**
    *   **Webpack:** A JavaScript module bundler. Used for bundling frontend assets.
*   **Communication:**
    *   **Slack:** For team communication and collaboration.
    *   **Jira:** For project management, issue tracking, and bug tracking.

## Development Environment

The development environment consists of:

*   **Operating System:** Developers can use their preferred operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   **Local Development Setup:** Each developer will have a local development environment with the necessary tools and dependencies installed (Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, etc.).  Docker Compose will be used to simplify the setup of the backend database and services.
*   **Version Control:** All code will be managed using Git and hosted on GitHub.
*   **Virtual Environments (Python):**  `venv` will be used to create isolated Python environments for each project to avoid dependency conflicts.
*   **Node Version Manager (nvm):**  Used to manage different Node.js versions.

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be employed to ensure the quality and reliability of the application:

*   **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components and functions in isolation.  Jest (for React components) and pytest (for Python backend) will be used.
*   **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between different components and modules.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Testing the entire application workflow from the user's perspective. Cypress will be used for E2E testing.
*   **API Testing:** Testing the API endpoints for functionality, performance, and security.  Postman or Insomnia will be used for manual API testing, and automated testing will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Regression Testing:**  Re-running existing tests after code changes to ensure that new code does not introduce regressions.
*   **Code Reviews:**  All code changes will be reviewed by other developers before being merged into the main branch.
*   **Performance Testing:** Load testing will be performed to measure the application's performance under heavy load.

## Deployment Process

The deployment process will involve the following steps:

1.  **Code Commit and Push:** Developers commit and push their code changes to a designated branch (e.g., `develop` for development deployments, `main` for production deployments).
2.  **Automated Build and Testing:** The CI/CD pipeline (see below) automatically builds the application and runs all automated tests.
3.  **Containerization:** Docker containers are built for the frontend and backend applications.
4.  **Image Registry:** The Docker images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS Elastic Container Registry).
5.  **Deployment to Environment:** The Docker containers are deployed to the target environment (e.g., development, staging, production).  This will likely involve using a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
6.  **Database Migrations:** Database migrations are run to update the database schema.
7.  **Monitoring:** The application is monitored for performance and errors.

## Continuous Integration Approach

A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will be implemented to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes:

*   **CI/CD Tool:** GitHub Actions will be used for CI/CD.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Code Commit:** When code is pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions is triggered.
    2.  **Build:** The code is built (e.g., React application is built, Python dependencies are installed).
    3.  **Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests are run.
    4.  **Code Analysis:** Static code analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, Flake8) are used to check for code quality and style issues.
    5.  **Docker Image Build:** Docker images are built for the frontend and backend.
    6.  **Image Push:** The Docker images are pushed to the container registry.
    7.  **Deployment:** The application is deployed to the target environment (based on the branch that triggered the pipeline).
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Automated build, testing, and deployment.
    *   Faster feedback loops.
    *   Reduced risk of errors.
    *   Improved code quality.
    *   Faster time to market.
