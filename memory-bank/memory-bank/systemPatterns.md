## System Patterns (systemPatterns.md)

This document outlines the system patterns employed for analyzing the arsaanalizvesunum project's CRM system and providing recommendations. It covers architectural design, data models, API definitions, component structure, integration points, and scalability strategy.

### 1. Architectural Design: Layered Architecture with Microservices Tendencies

The architectural design follows a layered approach, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability. While not a fully-fledged microservices architecture, we aim to identify and isolate functionalities that could be extracted into independent services in the future. This allows for incremental modernization and avoids a complete system rewrite.

*   **Presentation Layer:** This layer includes the user interface and any client-side logic. It interacts with the Application Layer through well-defined APIs.
*   **Application Layer:** This layer contains the business logic and orchestrates interactions between the Presentation Layer and the Domain Layer. It handles user requests, authentication, authorization, and transaction management.
*   **Domain Layer:** This layer encapsulates the core business entities and rules of the CRM system. It is independent of any specific technology or implementation details.
*   **Data Access Layer:** This layer provides an abstraction over the underlying data storage mechanisms. It handles data persistence, retrieval, and manipulation.

**Microservices Tendencies:** We will identify potential candidates for microservices based on the following criteria:

*   Independent deployability
*   Scaling requirements
*   Technology diversity

Examples might include:

*   **Reporting Service:** Handles complex reporting queries and data aggregation.
*   **Email Marketing Service:** Manages email campaigns and subscriber lists.
*   **Customer Segmentation Service:** Performs customer segmentation based on various criteria.

### 2. Data Models

The data models are designed to reflect the key entities and relationships within the CRM system. We will focus on analyzing the existing database schema and identifying potential areas for improvement.

**Key Entities:**

*   **Customer:** Represents a customer or prospect. Attributes include name, contact information, address, industry, etc.
*   **Contact:** Represents a specific contact person within a customer organization. Attributes include name, title, email, phone number, etc.
*   **Opportunity:** Represents a potential sale or deal. Attributes include name, stage, value, close date, etc.
*   **Account:** Represents a customer company or organization.
*   **Lead:** Represents a potential customer who has not yet been qualified.
*   **Activity:** Represents a task, event, or phone call related to a customer, opportunity, or contact. Attributes include type, status, due date, etc.
*   **Case:** Represents a customer service issue or support request. Attributes include status, priority, resolution, etc.

**Relationships:**

*   One-to-many relationship between Customer and Contact.
*   One-to-many relationship between Customer and Opportunity.
*   One-to-many relationship between Account and Contact.
*   One-to-many relationship between Account and Opportunity.
*   One-to-many relationship between Customer and Activity.
*   One-to-many relationship between Case and Activity.
*   Many-to-many relationship between Customer and Product (if applicable).

**Data Dictionary:** A detailed data dictionary will be created to document each entity, attribute, data type, and constraints. This will be crucial for understanding the existing data model and identifying potential data quality issues.

### 3. API Definitions

API definitions are essential for enabling communication between different components and services within the CRM system. We will analyze the existing APIs (if any) and define new APIs as needed.

**API Style:** RESTful APIs will be favored for their simplicity and scalability.

**API Endpoints (Examples):**

*   `/customers`:
    *   `GET`: Retrieve a list of customers.
    *   `POST`: Create a new customer.
*   `/customers/{customer_id}`:
    *   `GET`: Retrieve a specific customer.
    *   `PUT`: Update a specific customer.
    *   `DELETE`: Delete a specific customer.
*   `/opportunities`:
    *   `GET`: Retrieve a list of opportunities.
    *   `POST`: Create a new opportunity.
*   `/contacts`:
    *   `GET`: Retrieve a list of contacts.
    *   `POST`: Create a new contact.

**Data Format:** JSON will be used as the primary data format for API requests and responses.

**Authentication and Authorization:** API authentication and authorization will be implemented using industry-standard protocols such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT.

**API Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger will be used to document the APIs, making them easily discoverable and usable by developers.

### 4. Component Structure

The component structure defines the different modules and components that make up the CRM system.

**Core Components:**

*   **User Interface (UI):** Provides the user interface for interacting with the CRM system.
*   **Customer Management:** Manages customer data, including contacts, accounts, and leads.
*   **Sales Management:** Manages opportunities, quotes, and orders.
*   **Marketing Automation:** Automates marketing tasks such as email campaigns and lead nurturing.
*   **Service Management:** Manages customer service cases and support requests.
*   **Reporting and Analytics:** Provides reports and dashboards for tracking key metrics.
*   **Administration:** Manages user accounts, roles, and permissions.

**Component Interactions:** The components will interact with each other through APIs and message queues.

**Technology Stack:** The technology stack will be analyzed to determine the best technologies for each component.

### 5. Integration Points

Integration points define how the CRM system interacts with other systems.

**Potential Integration Points:**

*   **Email Marketing Platforms (e.g., Mailchimp, SendGrid):** Integrate with email marketing platforms to send targeted email campaigns.
*   **Social Media Platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn):** Integrate with social media platforms to track customer engagement and generate leads.
*   **Accounting Systems (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero):** Integrate with accounting systems to synchronize customer and financial data.
*   **ERP Systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle):** Integrate with ERP systems to share data across the organization.
*   **Payment Gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal):** Integrate with payment gateways to process online payments.
*   **Help Desk Systems (e.g., Zendesk, Jira Service Management):** Integrate with help desk systems for seamless customer support.

**Integration Strategies:**

*   **API-based Integration:** Use APIs to exchange data between systems.
*   **Message Queue-based Integration:** Use message queues to asynchronously communicate between systems.
*   **Data Synchronization:** Synchronize data between systems on a regular basis.

### 6. Scalability Strategy

The scalability strategy ensures that the CRM system can handle increasing workloads and user traffic.

**Scalability Requirements:**

*   **Horizontal Scaling:** The ability to add more servers or instances to handle increased traffic.
*   **Vertical Scaling:** The ability to increase the resources (e.g., CPU, memory) of existing servers.
*   **Database Scalability:** The ability to scale the database to handle increasing data volumes and query loads.

**Scalability Techniques:**

*   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
*   **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
*   **Database Sharding:** Divide the database into smaller, more manageable shards.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues to offload long-running tasks to background processes.
*   **Connection Pooling:** Reuse database connections to reduce the overhead of creating new connections.
