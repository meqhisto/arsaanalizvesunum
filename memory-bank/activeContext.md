## Active Context (activeContext.md)

This document outlines the current active context for the Arsa Analiz ve Sunum Projesi as of today.

### Current Sprint Goals

The primary goal of the current sprint (Sprint 3 - "Data Visualization Enhancement") is to enhance the data visualization capabilities of the web application. This includes:

*   Implementing interactive charts for property data (e.g., bar charts for price comparisons, scatter plots for location analysis).
*   Allowing users to customize chart parameters (e.g., data range, chart type, color scheme).
*   Integrating mapping functionality with heatmaps to visualize property density and price trends.
*   Improving the overall user experience of the data visualization interface.

### Ongoing Tasks

*   **Development:**
    *   Implement interactive bar charts for price comparisons (Assigned: Ali, Due: 15.05.2025)
    *   Integrate Leaflet.js library for mapping functionality (Assigned: Ayşe, Due: 16.05.2025)
    *   Develop API endpoint for retrieving property data for specific regions (Assigned: Mehmet, Due: 14.05.2025)
    *   Implement user authentication and authorization (Assigned: Elif, Due: 17.05.2025)
*   **Testing:**
    *   Unit testing for API endpoints (Assigned: Deniz, Due: 15.05.2025)
    *   Integration testing for data visualization components (Assigned: Can, Due: 18.05.2025)
*   **Design:**
    *   Finalize UI/UX design for the data visualization interface (Assigned: Burak, Due: 14.05.2025)
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Update API documentation with new endpoints (Assigned: Zeynep, Due: 16.05.2025)

### Known Issues

*   **Performance:** Initial performance tests with large datasets are showing slow rendering times for heatmaps. This needs further investigation and optimization.
*   **Data Accuracy:** There are inconsistencies in the data received from the external data provider regarding property sizes. We need to implement data validation and cleaning processes.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** The Leaflet.js library has some rendering issues on older versions of Internet Explorer. We need to address this for wider browser compatibility.

### Priorities

1.  **Data Accuracy:** Ensuring data accuracy is the highest priority. We need to address the data inconsistencies from the external provider immediately.
2.  **Performance:** Optimizing heatmap rendering performance is crucial for a good user experience.
3.  **Interactive Charts:** Implementing interactive charts is essential for meeting the sprint goals.
4.  **User Authentication:** Implementing user authentication and authorization to secure the application.

### Next Steps

*   **Data Validation:** Implement data validation and cleaning procedures to address data inconsistencies.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Investigate and implement performance optimizations for heatmap rendering.
*   **UI/UX Feedback:** Conduct user testing on the updated UI/UX design for the data visualization interface.
*   **Code Review:** Conduct code reviews for all implemented features to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.

### Meeting Notes

**Sprint Review Meeting - 12.05.2025**

*   Discussed progress on interactive chart implementation. Ali reported good progress, but needs assistance with implementing tooltips.
*   Ayşe reported challenges with integrating Leaflet.js with the existing application. The team agreed to provide support and explore alternative mapping libraries if needed.
*   Mehmet confirmed the completion of the API endpoint for retrieving property data.
*   The team discussed the performance issues with heatmaps and agreed to dedicate more time to optimization.
*   Action Items:
    *   Ali to research tooltip implementation options and seek assistance from the team.
    *   Ayşe to explore alternative mapping libraries if integration issues persist.
    *   Mehmet to provide API documentation to the team.
